Welcome to my portfolio.

## Boone Raye Flores

I'm a career shifter who previously worked in sales and marketing. My responsibilities included social media management, content creation, and merchant and partner acquisition.

However, I decided to pursue my passion and dream of becoming a web developer in 2020. The transition was difficult but I'm glad to be on this path. I'm still learning but I have already accomplished some projects that I'm proud of.

I'm dedicated to continuing my growth and development as a web developer.
