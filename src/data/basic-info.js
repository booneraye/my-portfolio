  INTRODUCTION: (
    <>
      <p>
        I'm a career shifter who previously worked in sales and marketing. My
        responsibilities included social media management, content creation, and
        merchant and partner acquisition.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I decided to pursue my passion and dream of becoming a web
        developer in 2020. The transition was difficult but I'm glad to be on
        this path. I'm still learning but I have already accomplished some
        projects that I'm proud of.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          I'm dedicated to continuing my growth and development as a web
          developer.
        </b>
