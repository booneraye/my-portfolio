        "Biyaheroes is a one-stop shop for booking bus and ferry rides online. I have been a part of this exciting project and made a minor contribution to the website by transforming the flip cards, enhancing the destination gallery, and addressing some design issues on the admin dashboard.\n\nThis project has been an eye-opening experience for me as it was my first coding-related project and I was faced with the challenge of working with Angular. Despite the difficulties, I am proud to have been a part of this project and to have learned valuable skills and knowledge in the process. ",

        'Vanwagon is another website under the Biyaheroes brand, which focuses on providing van rental services. I was tasked with creating a fully-functional, static website using React JS and Gatsby JS. The landing page features an image-text carousel to promote various service locations, flip cards to showcase the transport partners, blog cards to keep visitors informed and engaged, an "About Us" section to provide background on the company, and a footer to provide important information and links. This project was a unique opportunity for me to apply my web development skills and create a user-friendly and visually appealing website. It was also a chance to work with a new technology, React Js, and gain a deeper understanding of Gatsby JS. Overall, I am proud of the final product and believe it effectively showcases the offerings of Vanwagon.',

        "The BCTTC Coop dashboard was one of my first freelance projects and it was designed to provide a centralized platform for monitoring coop members and their relevant data.

This information can be easily extracted for further analysis.\n\nThe dashboard was developed using React JS.

        'Buybayin is a personal project I took on as a challenge to develop my skills as a web developer. The website is designed to serve as an e-commerce platform for small-scale merchants to sell their products directly to customers. Buybayin offers a unique feature called PASABUY, where users can create a wishlist of items they wish to purchase, and the websites admin will locate the nearest rider to complete the delivery. The name "Buybayin" is a play on words, combining "Buy" and "Baybayin", the indigenous script of the Philippines. This website is dedicated to providing a user-friendly and accessible platform for the Filipino community. Through this project, I have honed my skills in developing e-commerce websites and have gained valuable experience in integrating various functionalities and features.

      description: "The 711 online calls dashboard is one of my most substantial and challenging projects to date. This application was developed with the primary purpose of enabling users to monitor and manage their call logs with ease and efficiency. The dashboard provides an intuitive interface that allows users to view the details of each call made, including the date and time of the call, the caller's information, and the status of the call. Additionally, the application enables users to manage store details and generate reports, which can be useful for monitoring call trends and performance over time. \n\nThe speed and stability of this application are critical to the success of the sales department, as they rely on it to efficiently manage their call logs and make informed decisions. This project was a significant undertaking, but I am proud of the final product and the impact it has had on the efficiency and effectiveness of the sales department.",

With the number of orders received by my current company reaching up to 150 orders a day, they needed a solution to manage and monitor all the orders in one place. This is where I came in and developed the application to help them. The application allows the user to upload, manage, and extract data and reports related to Lazada and Shopee orders. This has greatly improved the efficiency of their operations as they can now balance their monthly orders, including computation of payment release, in real-time, reducing the previously time-consuming process of balancing that used to take three months to complete.",

Prior to the development of this app, the company was only able to process 50 orders per day, even though they received more than 100 orders daily. This was due to the time-consuming process of manually processing each order, which took more than an hour to complete.\n\nHowever, with the help of the Lazada/Shopee/Serial Basic Tool, the company can now easily and efficiently manage their orders. All they need to do is upload a file from Lazada/Shopee and within just 2 minutes, they will have the report they need to process the orders. This has significantly reduced the time and effort required to process orders and has allowed the company to manage a larger volume of orders in a more efficient manner.",

      title: "OFFLINE TO ONLINE DTR & ATTENDANCE MONITORING DASHBOARD",
      description: "I developed an application that integrates all of the company's employee attendance, leave, and overtime monitoring activities into one convenient dashboard. Previously, the company was using an offline fingerprint machine to collect attendance information and a separate application to monitor leaves and overtime. The process of generating a daily time record (DTR) was a time-consuming and labor-intensive task that took up to three days to complete.\n\nTo streamline this process, I created an API to connect to the other application and then designed a user-friendly dashboard. The HR staff can now simply upload a .dat file from the fingerprint machine and the DTRs will be generated instantly. This innovative solution has saved the HR department significant time and effort, allowing them to focus on other important tasks.",
